Enter the follwoing to run: %run PHSX815_HW8.py -sample_size 100 -Nexp 1000 -n 20 -prob 0.5

The 2D histogram with colorbar is the result of calculating the mean for Nexp chi-square distribution, each with a mean provided by a uniform random variable.

The scatterplots (Fig. 25; different zooms) are my attempt at calculating the mean for a randomly generated gaussian distribution (Nexp times), each with a true mean sampled evenly across the range [-10, 10].
