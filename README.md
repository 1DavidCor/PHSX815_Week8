The 2D histogram with colorbar is the result of calculating the mean for each chi-square distribution, each with a mean provided by a uniform random variable.

The scatterplot is my attempt at calculating the mean for a randomly generated gaussian distribution, each with a true mean sampled evenly across the range [-10, 10].
